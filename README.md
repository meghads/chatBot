Python Chatbot - Basic Conversation Starter

This repository contains the code for a simple Python chatbot designed to have basic conversations with users. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user input.

Features:

Greetings: Recognizes and responds to common greetings like "hello", "hi", and "what's up?"
Basic Conversation: Attempts to understand user input and provide relevant responses based on the provided training data (currently focused on Python basics).
Learning: The chatbot can dynamically learn new words and phrases from user interactions, potentially improving its responses over time.
Requirements:

Python 3.x
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) libraries:
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
numpy
random
string
sklearn.feature_extraction.text
sklearn.metrics.pairwise
Installation:

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

Install the required libraries using pip:

Bash
pip install nltk numpy random string scikit-learn
Use code with caution.

Download the NLTK resources:

Bash
python -m nltk.downloader punkt wordnet
Use code with caution.

Usage:

Clone or download this repository.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the chatbot.py file. Â  

Run the script:

Bash
python chatbot.py
Use code with caution.

Interaction:

The chatbot will introduce itself as "Stark" and invite you to have a conversation. You can type your questions or statements, and the chatbot will attempt to understand and respond based on its training data. If it doesn't understand, it will apologize.

To exit the conversation, type "bye".

Dataset and Training:

This current version uses a basic dataset focused on Python basics included in the chatbot.txt file. However, it can be enhanced by adding more text data related to your desired domain of conversation. This will improve the chatbot's ability to understand and respond to user queries.

Further Development:

Enhance the dataset with more diverse conversations.
Implement more sophisticated NLP techniques for better understanding of user intent.
Utilize machine learning models for improved response generation.
Integrate external knowledge sources for more informed responses.
Disclaimer:

This is a basic demonstration of NLP techniques applied to chatbot development. It is intended for educational purposes and may require further development for practical applications.
